## Overview
### Description
[An app oriented towards kids learning about the outdoors. This app uses a “20 questions” style format and asks the user questions about the animal the user has found and then displays the proposed animal/species/insect in the local area, based on data collected by an API.]

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Educational
- **Mobile:** This application would primarily be presented as a mobile application, as it is meant to be transportable with the user to identify different native species in visited areas (such as on hikes). It may offer limited functionality as a web application for users who want to educate themselves or others on hikes or trips ahead of time or for recreational interests.
- **Story:** This application analyzes a user's location and offers a detailed view of information of the animals native to that area. They can then store that information in their profiles or share it with friends. Users can also recreationally go and learn about the top 100 most frequent animals in the United States!
- **Market:** Targeting young learners interested in the environment and animals.
- **Habit:** App can be used as often as they would like. It would depend on how often they would like to identify some local species.
- **Scope:** We would first start by using location based data to provide animals that are in the user's area. The app would also offer an opportunity for anyone to learn about specific animals as well by selecting from a collection view.
